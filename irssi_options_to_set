These are some options I need to set in irssi to make it work with the xmonad notifier.

set beep_when_window_active ON
set beep_when_away ON
set beep_msg_level MSGS NOTICES DCC DCCMSGS HILIGHT ALL
set bell_beeps ON

these are under settings

  "fe-common/core" = {
    bell_beeps = "yes";
    beep_msg_level = "MSGS NOTICES INVITES DCC DCCMSGS HILIGHT ALL";
    beep_when_away = "yes";
    beep_when_window_active = "yes";
  };
